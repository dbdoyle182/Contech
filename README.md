#### Overview:
* The inspiration behind this project came from our experience when beginning UNCC’s Coding Bootcamp. 
* If we searched for an unfamiliar term online, we could easily find ourselves inundated with vast amounts of information.
* We found that it wasn’t just developers that ran into this issue, but also those that worked with developers.
* __Our app is a quick reference tool that provides simplified definitions to these complex terms.__
* __Our app is for developers, those that work with developers, or anyone that is new to the industry.__
